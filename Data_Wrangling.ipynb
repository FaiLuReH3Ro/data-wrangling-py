Since raw datasets often contain inconsistencies or missing values, they must be cleaned and prepared to enable accurate and reliable analysis.\n","\n","I applied data wrangling techniques in Python to clean the dataset before performing the analysis. Using Python libraries such as Pandas and Numpy in a Jupyter Notebook, I removed duplicate rows, imputed missing values, performed data normalization, and dropped irrelevant columns. The imputing technique generally replaces missing numeric data with the average and replaces missing categorical data with the most frequent. However, I purposely did not impute every missing value. Since the objective is to gather insights into developers' technologies, I left those columns alone because I did not want to affect the results by skewing the data. Additionally, I dropped columns that will not contribute to the final analysis to improve efficiency and reduce loading times.\n","\n","## Repository\n","\n","Check out the repository on
